         <p>HTML5 has a lot of areas that its older version was lacking.
             One of the differences between HTML and HTML5 is that HTML5 has new elements such as video and audio.
             HTML5 also allows storing some data on the user´s device.
            For developers HTML5 gives consistent error handling, enhanced element semantics etc.   </p>
